Assignment: AI & ML Role - Python Programming
Objective:
This assignment aims to evaluate your proficiency in Python programming and your understanding of key concepts in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).
Instructions:
You are tasked with completing the following assignment, demonstrating your skills in AI and ML using Python programming:
Problem Statement: Predicting Employee Attrition
Dataset: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance
Instructions:
1. Dataset Analysis and Preprocessing:
   * Download the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset from a reputable source (e.g., Kaggle).
   * Analyze the dataset to understand its structure and features. It contains various attributes related to employee demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, performance ratings, etc., along with a target variable indicating whether an employee has left the company (Yes or No).
   * Perform preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary.
2. Model Development:
   * Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   * Choose suitable machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine) for binary classification.
   * Implement the selected algorithm(s) using Python libraries like scikit-learn or pytorch.
   * Train the model(s) on the training data and evaluate their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
3. Model Evaluation and Optimization:
   * Analyze the performance of the trained model(s) using evaluation metrics.
   * Explore techniques for model optimization, such as hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, or model ensemble methods, to improve performance.
   * Optimize the model parameters and evaluate the impact on model performance.
4. Documentation and Presentation:
   * Document the entire process, including dataset analysis, preprocessing steps, model development, evaluation results, and optimization techniques used.
   * Prepare a concise report summarizing your findings, insights gained, challenges encountered, and recommendations for reducing employee attrition.
   * Optionally, create a presentation to showcase your work, highlighting key steps, results, and conclusions.


Submission:
Submit your assignment as a google drive link (public) or github containing:
* Python code files (.py) implementing the data analysis, model development, and evaluation.
* A README file providing instructions for running the code and any additional information.
* A PDF report summarizing your findings and insights.
* A video presentation for showcasing your work (important).
